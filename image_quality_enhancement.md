# Image Quality Enhancement Options

## Current Status

### Completed ✅
- Basic image quality table structure
- Default quality metrics (clarity, composition)
- Frontend display of quality scores
- Quality-based special detection highlighting

### In Progress 🏗️
- None currently

### Not Started 🚧
- OpenAI Vision API integration
- Google Cloud Vision API integration
- Local ML solutions
- Custom metrics implementation

## 1. OpenAI Vision API Integration (Next Priority)

### Advantages
- Advanced understanding of image composition and aesthetics
- Can identify interesting behaviors and interactions
- Natural language descriptions of what makes a shot special
- Could identify rare or unusual poses/behaviors

### Implementation
```python
async def analyze_with_openai(image_path: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Use OpenAI's Vision API to analyze image quality and content.
    
    Example prompt:
    "Analyze this bird photo and rate it on:
     1. Image quality (clarity, focus)
     2. Composition (framing, background)
     3. Bird behavior (feeding, interaction)
     4. Special characteristics (rare pose, multiple birds)
     Provide ratings from 0-1 for each category."
    """
    response = await openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {"type": "text", "text": "Analyze this bird photo..."},
                    {"type": "image_url", "url": f"file://{image_path}"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    )
    return parse_openai_response(response)
```

### Batch Processing
```python
async def batch_process_images(image_paths: List[str], batch_size: int = 10):
    """Process images in batches to respect rate limits."""
    for i in range(0, len(image_paths), batch_size):
        batch = image_paths[i:i + batch_size]
        tasks = [analyze_with_openai(path) for path in batch]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        # Store results in database
```

### Cost Considerations
- GPT-4V: $0.01/image
- Implement caching to avoid re-analyzing images
- Process in batches during off-peak hours

## 2. Google Cloud Vision API (Alternative Option)

### Advantages
- Purpose-built image quality metrics
- More cost-effective for high volume
- Additional features like landmark detection

### Implementation
```python
from google.cloud import vision

def analyze_with_google_vision(image_path: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Use Google Cloud Vision API for image quality analysis.
    """
    client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()
    
    with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
        content = image_file.read()
    
    image = vision.Image(content=content)
    
    # Get image properties
    response = client.image_properties(image=image)
    props = response.image_properties_annotation
    
    # Get object detection
    objects = client.object_localization(image=image)
    
    return {
        'quality_score': calculate_quality_score(props),
        'composition_score': analyze_composition(objects),
        'detection_confidence': objects.localized_object_annotations[0].score
    }
```

## 3. Local ML Solutions (Future Enhancement)

### TensorFlow IQA
```python
def analyze_with_tf_iqa(image_path: str) -> float:
    """
    Use TensorFlow IQA model for quality assessment.
    """
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/iqa_model')
    image = preprocess_image(image_path)
    return model.predict(image)[0]
```

### BRISQUE Score
```python
from imquality import brisque

def get_brisque_score(image_path: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate BRISQUE score for image quality.
    Lower scores indicate better quality.
    """
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    score = brisque.score(image)
    return normalize_brisque_score(score)
```

## 4. Custom Metrics (Future Enhancement)

### Bird Positioning Analysis
```python
def analyze_bird_position(detection_box: Dict) -> float:
    """
    Calculate how well-centered the bird is in the frame.
    """
    center_x = (detection_box['x_min'] + detection_box['x_max']) / 2
    center_y = (detection_box['y_min'] + detection_box['y_max']) / 2
    
    # Calculate distance from image center
    distance_from_center = math.sqrt(
        (center_x - 0.5) ** 2 + 
        (center_y - 0.5) ** 2
    )
    
    return 1 - (distance_from_center / 0.707)  # Normalize to 0-1
```

### Multiple Bird Detection
```python
def analyze_bird_interaction(detections: List[Dict]) -> float:
    """
    Score based on number of birds and their proximity.
    """
    if len(detections) < 2:
        return 0.0
        
    # Calculate interaction score based on proximity
    distances = calculate_bird_distances(detections)
    return score_bird_interactions(distances)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: OpenAI Vision Integration (Next)

2. Implement caching system
3. Create background processing job
4. Update frontend to show detailed analysis

### Phase 2: Custom Metrics (Future)

2. Add multiple bird detection
3. Create composition scoring

### Phase 3: Local ML (Future)

2. Implement BRISQUE scoring
3. Create hybrid scoring system

## Configuration Updates Needed
