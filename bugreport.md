## Findings

### Frontend-Backend Interface Mismatches

1. Detection Type Inconsistencies:
   - Frontend expects `scientific_name` in Detection interface but backend uses `display_name`
   - Backend adds `scientific_name` field in _format_detection by copying display_name
   - Potential confusion between display_name and scientific_name fields
    - No shared type definitions between frontend and backend
    - Missing TypeScript interfaces for API responses

2. Optional Fields Handling:
   - Frontend marks several fields as optional (?) but backend always includes them:
     * enhancement_status
     * category_name
     * camera_name
     * detection_index
   - This could lead to runtime type errors if backend ever returns null
    - No validation of optional field values
    - Inconsistent null handling across components

3. Special Detection Fields:
   - Frontend type defines `highlight_type` as strict union: 'rare' | 'quality' | 'behavior'
   - Backend API route validates these values but database query doesn't enforce this constraint
   - Risk of invalid values reaching frontend
    - No shared enum definitions between frontend and backend

4. Image Path Inconsistencies:
   - Frontend expects `enhanced_path` and `enhanced_thumbnail_path`
   - Backend constructs these dynamically in multiple places:
     * Direct file paths in enhanced_snapshot/enhanced_thumbnail routes
     * URL paths in api_enhance_image
   - No consistent format for these paths
    - Missing path transformation layer

5. Units Configuration Mismatch:
    - Frontend components default to imperial units while backend defaults to metric
    - No centralized units configuration
    - Hardcoded unit conversions in frontend components
    - No validation of unit values in API responses
    - Missing unit conversion utility

### Database Layer Issues

1. Query Result Transformation:
   - _format_detection function makes assumptions about column order
   - No explicit error handling for missing columns
   - Relies on array indices instead of named columns
    - No connection pooling implementation
    - Missing query optimization

2. Null Handling:
   - Inconsistent null handling between database and API:
     * Some fields use COALESCE in SQL
     * Others handle nulls in Python formatting
     * Frontend doesn't expect nulls but might receive them
    - No validation of numeric ranges
    - Missing NOT NULL constraints on critical fields

### WebSocket Communication Issues

1. Message Type Safety:
   - Frontend expects specific message types ('status', 'detection', 'pong')
   - Backend WebSocket server blindly broadcasts all received messages
   - No type validation on either end
   - No TypeScript interface defining the message structure
    - Missing error recovery mechanisms

2. Detection Notification Format:
   - Frontend assumes detection messages have 'common_name' in data
   - No guarantee this field exists in broadcast messages
   - Missing error handling for malformed detection data
    - No validation of message format

3. Connection Management:
   - Frontend tracks connection count but backend doesn't broadcast connection status updates
   - Status message handling exists in frontend but no corresponding backend implementation
   - Potential stale connection counts

4. Ping/Pong Implementation:
   - Frontend sends ping messages but backend doesn't specifically handle them
   - Could lead to unnecessary reconnections

### Weather Service Integration Issues

1. Units Inconsistency:
   - Weather data stored in database doesn't include units
   - Units determined at runtime from config
   - No validation that stored data matches current unit setting
   - Could lead to mixed metric/imperial values if config changes
    - Frontend components assume imperial units
    - No centralized unit configuration service

2. Weather Condition Standardization:
   - Weather conditions stored as lowercase strings from OpenWeather API
   - No validation against allowed values
   - Frontend may receive unexpected condition strings
   - No TypeScript enum/type for valid conditions
    - Missing weather condition mapping layer

3. Nullable Fields Handling:
   - Several weather fields can be null in database schema
   - Frontend components may not handle null values properly
   - Particularly in correlation and pattern analysis:
     * temperature
     * wind_speed
     * precipitation
     * cloud_cover
    - No error states for missing data
    - Missing data validation layer

4. Performance Issues:
    - No caching strategy for weather data
    - Complex queries without optimization
    - Missing connection pooling
    - Unbounded queries without pagination
    - No data refresh mechanisms

### Image Processing Pipeline Issues

1. Path Handling Inconsistencies:
   - Enhanced image paths stored in database as absolute paths (/data/images/...)
   - API returns these absolute paths directly
   - Frontend expects relative paths for image URLs
   - No consistent path transformation layer

2. Quality Score Schema:
   - Quality scores structure not formally defined
   - Frontend Detection interface expects specific score fields:
     * visibility_score
     * clarity_score
     * composition_score
   - Backend uses different naming in quality_model.assess_quality():
     * clarity (vs clarity_score)
     * No type definition ensuring all required scores exist

3. Error State Handling:
   - Failed enhancement still returns success response with enhanced=false
   - No distinction between "not needed" vs "failed" enhancement states

### Special Detection Service Issues

1. Score Calculation Inconsistencies:
   - Mixes different score types without normalization:
     * Raw detection scores (0-1 range)
     * Frequency scores (0-1 range)
     * Quality scores (potentially different ranges)
   - Arbitrary threshold (0.7) applied to different score types
   - No documentation of score ranges in frontend

2. Behavior Tags Schema:
   - Stored as JSON string in database
   - No validation of behavior tag values
   - Combines tags from multiple sources without standardization
   - Frontend has no type definition for valid behavior tags

### Database Schema Issues

1. Inconsistent Name Fields:
   - detections.display_name used for scientific name
   - birdnames.scientific_name as foreign key
   - No enforced foreign key between detections and birdnames
   - Comment suggests display_name is scientific name but not enforced

2. Missing Constraints:
   - No CHECK constraints on score ranges (0-1) for:
     * detections.score
     * rarity_scores.frequency_score
     * rarity_scores.seasonal_score
     * vision_analysis_cache.clarity_score
     * vision_analysis_cache.composition_score
   - No NOT NULL on important fields like scores
   - weather_condition field lacks enumeration constraints
   - behavior_tags stored as TEXT without JSON validation

3. Missing Indexes:
   - No index on detection_weather.weather_id despite being a foreign key
   - No timestamp index on image_quality table despite temporal queries

4. Timestamp Handling:
   - Mix of timezone-aware and naive timestamps
   - Some queries use localtime, others don't
   - No consistent timezone handling strategy
   - Potential for timezone-related bugs in date comparisons

5. Duplicate Data:
   - visibility_score stored but also calculated from clarity/composition
   - behavior_tags duplicated between image_quality and vision_analysis_cache
