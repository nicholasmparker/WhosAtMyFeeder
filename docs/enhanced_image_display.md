# Enhanced Image Display Feature

## Current State
The system currently processes and enhances bird detection images but doesn't expose these enhancements to users:

1. Image Processing Flow:
   - Frigate captures original images
   - System processes images for quality assessment
   - Images below quality threshold are enhanced
   - Enhanced versions stored in data/enhanced_images
   - Quality metrics stored in database

2. Frontend Display:
   - Only shows original Frigate images
   - Uses direct routes to Frigate API:
     ```javascript
     /frigate/${frigateEvent}/thumbnail.jpg
     /frigate/${frigateEvent}/snapshot.jpg
     ```
   - No access to enhanced versions
   - No way to compare original vs enhanced

3. Backend API:
   - Has enhancement endpoints:
     ```python
     /api/image/enhance/<detection_id>
     /api/image/batch-process
     ```
   - No routes to serve enhanced images
   - Quality metrics available but unused

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Backend Changes
- Add new routes to serve enhanced images:
  ```python
  /api/enhanced/<frigate_event>/snapshot.jpg
  /api/enhanced/<frigate_event>/thumbnail.jpg
  ```
- Add endpoint to get enhancement status:
  ```python
  /api/image/status/<detection_id>
  ```
- Add comparison endpoint:
  ```python
  /api/image/compare/<detection_id>
  ```

### 2. Frontend Changes
- Add enhanced image toggle component
- Implement side-by-side comparison view
- Add quality metric display
- Update image components to handle both versions

### 3. Database Changes
- Add enhancement status tracking
- Store paths to enhanced images
- Track quality improvement metrics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure
1. Create enhanced image routes
2. Implement status endpoints
3. Add comparison functionality
4. Update database schema

### Phase 2: Frontend Components
1. Create EnhancedImage component
2. Implement image toggle functionality
3. Add comparison view
4. Update existing components

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Connect frontend to new endpoints
2. Implement caching strategy
3. Add loading states
4. Error handling

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
1. Unit tests for new components
2. Integration tests
3. Update API documentation
4. User documentation

## Technical Considerations

### Storage
- Enhanced images stored in data/enhanced_images
- Need to handle cleanup of old enhanced images
- Consider caching strategy

### Performance
- Lazy loading of enhanced versions
- Progressive image loading
- Caching headers for enhanced images

### UI/UX
- Clear indication of enhanced vs original
- Smooth transition between versions
- Loading states during enhancement
- Error states for failed enhancements

## Future Enhancements
1. Batch enhancement requests
2. Auto-enhancement settings
3. Custom enhancement parameters
4. Enhancement history tracking
5. Quality improvement metrics

## Dependencies
- Frontend:
  - Image comparison library
  - Loading component
  - Toggle component
- Backend:
  - Image serving middleware
  - Caching layer
  - Storage management

## Success Metrics
1. Image quality improvements
2. User engagement with enhanced images
3. System performance impact
4. Storage utilization

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 1 week
- Phase 3: 3 days
- Phase 4: 2 days
- Total: ~2.5 weeks

## Risks
1. Storage growth
2. Performance impact
3. Cache invalidation
4. Enhancement processing time

## Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement storage cleanup
2. Optimize image serving
3. Add caching layer
4. Background processing

## Notes
- Need to maintain backward compatibility
- Consider mobile performance
- Plan for scaling storage
- Monitor enhancement quality
