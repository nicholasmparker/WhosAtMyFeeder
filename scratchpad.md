# Project Scratchpad

This file will be used to jot down notes, ideas, and plans for improving the project.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Backend
- Flask web application
- SQLite database (birdnames.db, speciesid.db)
- TensorFlow Lite model integration
- Frigate integration for camera/video
- REST endpoints for:
  - Bird detections
  - Image/video retrieval
  - Daily summaries
  - Hourly statistics

### Frontend
- Vue 2.6.14 (browser import)
- Bootstrap 5.1.3
- jQuery dependency
- Mixed template rendering (Jinja2 + Vue)
- Single Vue component (RecentDetections)

## Vue 3 Upgrade Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Modern Build System
- [ ] Initialize Vue 3 with Vite
- [ ] Setup TypeScript support
- [ ] Configure build process for Docker integration
- [ ] Setup ESLint + Prettier
- [ ] Configure Vue Router
- [ ] Setup Pinia for state management

### Phase 2: Component Migration
- [ ] Convert existing templates to Vue components:
  - [ ] RecentDetections (upgrade existing)
  - [ ] DailySummary
  - [ ] DetectionsByHour
  - [ ] DetectionsByScientificName
  - [ ] Navigation
  - [ ] DatePicker
- [ ] Create shared components:
  - [ ] ImageViewer (for thumbnails/snapshots)
  - [ ] VideoPlayer (for clips)
  - [ ] DataTable (reusable table component)
  - [ ] StatisticsCard

### Phase 3: State Management & API Integration
- [ ] Setup API module structure
- [ ] Implement Pinia stores:
  - [ ] detections (recent, by hour, by species)
  - [ ] dailySummary
  - [ ] mediaAssets (images/videos)
  - [ ] filters (date, species)
- [ ] Add real-time updates capability
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add loading states

### Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Implement responsive grid layout
- [ ] Add transitions/animations
- [ ] Improve image/video viewer
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Implement infinite scroll for detections
- [ ] Add filter/search capabilities
- [ ] Implement data visualization (charts/graphs)

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Setup proper code splitting
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for routes
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support
- [ ] Optimize image loading
- [ ] Add proper caching strategy
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets

## Docker Integration Notes

- Current setup uses port 7766
- Need to configure Vite dev server
- Consider multi-stage build for production
- Setup volume mounts for development
- Configure hot reload for development

## API Endpoints to Create/Modify

- [ ] GET /api/detections/recent
- [ ] GET /api/detections/daily-summary
- [ ] GET /api/detections/by-hour
- [ ] GET /api/detections/by-species
- [ ] GET /api/media/thumbnail/:id
- [ ] GET /api/media/snapshot/:id
- [ ] GET /api/media/clip/:id
