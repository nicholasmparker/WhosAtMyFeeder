# Special Detection Highlights Integration

## Overview
Implement a system to highlight and surface special bird detections, including rare species visits and exceptional quality photographs. This enhancement will help ensure important or unusual detections are not missed.

## Key Components

### 1. Rarity Detection System
- Historical frequency tracking per species
- Rarity score calculation algorithm
- Seasonal pattern consideration
- First-of-season detection
- eBird API integration for regional context

### 2. Image Quality Assessment
- ML-based quality scoring
  * Focus/clarity analysis
  * Composition evaluation
  * Bird pose/position assessment
- Behavior detection
  * Feeding activities
  * Bird interactions
  * Unusual behaviors
- Full vs partial visibility scoring

### 3. Smart Notifications
- Configurable alert system for:
  * Rare species detections
  * High-quality images
  * Unusual behaviors
  * First-time visitors
  * Season-first appearances

### 4. Community Features
- Favorite/bookmark system
- Sharing capabilities
- Community voting
- Behavior tagging
- Monthly highlights gallery

### 5. Automated Analysis
- ML-powered detection of:
  * Behavior patterns
  * Unusual timing
  * Group activities
  * Predator/prey interactions
  * Nesting behaviors

## Database Changes

### New Tables
1. rarity_scores
   - species_id
   - frequency_score
   - seasonal_score
   - last_seen
   - first_seen_this_season

2. image_quality
   - detection_id
   - clarity_score
   - composition_score
   - behavior_tags
   - visibility_score

3. special_detections
   - detection_id
   - highlight_type (rare/quality/behavior)
   - score
   - community_votes
   - featured_status

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
- GET /api/special-detections/recent
- GET /api/special-detections/by-type
- POST /api/special-detections/vote
- GET /api/special-detections/monthly-highlights
- GET /api/species/rarity-scores

### Modified Endpoints
- Update /api/detections/recent to include special detection flags
- Update /api/detections/by-species to include rarity information

## Frontend Components

### New Components
1. SpecialDetectionGallery.vue
   - Showcase highlighted detections
   - Filtering by type
   - Sorting options

2. RarityIndicator.vue
   - Visual indicator for species rarity
   - Historical context display

3. ImageQualityBadge.vue
   - Quality score display
   - Behavior tags
   - Special detection markers

### Modified Components
1. RecentDetections.vue
   - Add special detection indicators
   - Highlight rare species
   - Show quality badges

2. DetectionsBySpecies.vue
   - Include rarity information
   - Add frequency trends

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Set up database tables
- [ ] Implement basic rarity scoring
- [ ] Create API endpoints
- [ ] Add frontend components

### Phase 2: ML Integration
- [ ] Implement image quality assessment
- [ ] Add behavior detection
- [ ] Set up automated analysis

### Phase 3: Community Features
- [ ] Add voting system
- [ ] Implement sharing
- [ ] Create highlights gallery

### Phase 4: Refinement
- [ ] Tune scoring algorithms
- [ ] Optimize notifications
- [ ] Add advanced filtering
- [ ] Implement seasonal analysis

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for scoring algorithms
2. Integration tests for ML components
3. API endpoint testing
4. Frontend component testing
5. End-to-end user flow testing

## Monitoring & Metrics
- Track highlight accuracy
- Monitor user engagement
- Measure notification effectiveness
- Analyze community participation
- Track system performance impact
