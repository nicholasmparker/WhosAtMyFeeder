# Special Detection Highlights Integration

## Overview
Implement a system to highlight and surface special bird detections, including rare species visits and exceptional quality photographs. This enhancement will help ensure important or unusual detections are not missed.

## Key Components

### 1. Rarity Detection System ‚úÖ
- [x] Historical frequency tracking per species
- [x] Rarity score calculation algorithm
- [x] Seasonal pattern consideration
- [ ] First-of-season detection
- [ ] eBird API integration for regional context

### 2. Image Quality Assessment üöß
- [ ] ML-based quality scoring
  * Focus/clarity analysis
  * Composition evaluation
  * Bird pose/position assessment
- [ ] Behavior detection
  * Feeding activities
  * Bird interactions
  * Unusual behaviors
- [ ] Full vs partial visibility scoring

### 3. Smart Notifications üöß
- [ ] Configurable alert system for:
  * Rare species detections
  * High-quality images
  * Unusual behaviors
  * First-time visitors
  * Season-first appearances

### 4. Community Features
- [x] Favorite/bookmark system (Featured status)
- [ ] Sharing capabilities
- [x] Community voting
- [ ] Behavior tagging
- [ ] Monthly highlights gallery

### 5. Automated Analysis üöß
- [ ] ML-powered detection of:
  * Behavior patterns
  * Unusual timing
  * Group activities
  * Predator/prey interactions
  * Nesting behaviors

## Database Changes

### New Tables ‚úÖ
1. rarity_scores
   - [x] species_id
   - [x] frequency_score
   - [x] seasonal_score
   - [x] last_seen
   - [x] first_seen_this_season

2. image_quality
   - [x] detection_id
   - [x] clarity_score
   - [x] composition_score
   - [x] behavior_tags
   - [x] visibility_score

3. special_detections
   - [x] detection_id
   - [x] highlight_type (rare/quality/behavior)
   - [x] score
   - [x] community_votes
   - [x] featured_status

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints ‚úÖ
- [x] GET /api/special-detections/recent
- [x] GET /api/special-detections/by-type
- [x] POST /api/special-detections/vote
- [ ] GET /api/special-detections/monthly-highlights
- [ ] GET /api/species/rarity-scores

### Modified Endpoints ‚úÖ
- [x] Update /api/detections/recent to include special detection flags
- [x] Update /api/detections/by-species to include rarity information

## Frontend Components

### New Components
1. SpecialDetectionGallery.vue ‚úÖ
   - [x] Showcase highlighted detections
   - [x] Filtering by type
   - [x] Sorting options

2. RarityIndicator.vue üöß
   - [ ] Visual indicator for species rarity
   - [ ] Historical context display

3. ImageQualityBadge.vue ‚úÖ
   - [x] Quality score display
   - [ ] Behavior tags
   - [x] Special detection markers

### Modified Components üöß
1. RecentDetections.vue
   - [ ] Add special detection indicators
   - [ ] Highlight rare species
   - [ ] Show quality badges

2. DetectionsBySpecies.vue
   - [ ] Include rarity information
   - [ ] Add frequency trends

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ
- [x] Set up database tables
- [x] Implement basic rarity scoring
- [x] Create API endpoints
- [x] Add frontend components

### Phase 2: ML Integration üöß
- [ ] Implement image quality assessment
- [ ] Add behavior detection
- [ ] Set up automated analysis

### Phase 3: Community Features üèóÔ∏è
- [x] Add voting system
- [ ] Implement sharing
- [ ] Create highlights gallery

### Phase 4: Refinement üöß
- [ ] Tune scoring algorithms
- [ ] Optimize notifications
- [ ] Add advanced filtering
- [ ] Implement seasonal analysis

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for scoring algorithms
2. Integration tests for ML components
3. API endpoint testing
4. Frontend component testing
5. End-to-end user flow testing
